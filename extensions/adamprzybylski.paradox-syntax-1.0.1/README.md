# Paradox Syntax #

This extension is intended to help modders creating mods for Paradox Interactive games by providing basic yet necessary conveniences.

## Current Features ##

* Syntax support
* Custom theme
* Snippets

## Syntax Support ##

Syntax support is provided for **_.txt_** and **_.mod_** files. However due to the fact that VS Code by default sets the **_.txt_** files to **_Plain Text_** syntax you will have to set the association manually.  
* To do that, after you have opened the **_.txt_** file, you have to click in the bottom right of the window where it says **_Plain Text_**. In the newly opened popup type in '**_Paradox_**' and select the **_Paradox (paradox)_**.  
* Alternatively, you can open the **_Command Palette_** (by default \[Ctrl]+\[Shift]+\[P], or in the menu click **_View_** > **_Command Palette..._**) and type in the newly opened popup **_Change Languague Mode_**. Press \[Enter] then type in '**_Paradox_**' and select the **_Paradox (paradox)_**.

## Colour Theme ##

Extension comes with it's own colour theme but it's not enabled by default. If you wish to activate it go into the **_Command Palette_** (by default \[Ctrl]+\[Shift]+\[P], or in the menu click **_View_** > **_Command Palette..._**), type in '**_Color Theme_**' and press \[Enter]. Type in '**_Paradox Theme_**' and press \[Enter] again.

## Snippets ##

Extension comes with a few snippets. Currently available are the ones helping with event creation as this is mostly the main thing that a modder might need and at the same time is somewhat universal between different games.
