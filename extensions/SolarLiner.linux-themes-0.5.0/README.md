## An integrated color theme for the most popular Linux GTK themes

These VS Code themes integrate seamlessly with your GTK themes to provide a more integrated experience.

For the Arc theme, the syntax coloring is the default VS Code one. For Adapta, it is taken from [Mattia Astorino's great Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/vsc-material-theme) (an alternative to this Adapta theme!)

I created those themes myself to suit my needs - I hope you wil like it too!
